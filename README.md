# PickMe

### About
Pick Me is an Android Application for allocating a person to everyone in a list. This application was made from the idea of the old traditional 'names in a hat', where names would be writen on small peices of paper and put in a hat, and each person would pick a name from the hat. The purpose is to randomly allocate a name to each person, this will help in situations like - who will buy a gift for who on Christmas!
